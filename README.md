## Overview

BBC Bot is built for automated tasks on your AWS EC2 instance. In our current setup, changes pushed to the repository are deployed automatically via GitHub Actions. The deployment pipeline uses secure SSH connectivity (powered by [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action)) to pull the latest changes on your AWS instance and restart the bot using PM2.

This bot can be used as-is or extended to power additional features (like notifications, data processing, or even a Discord bot) based on your requirements.
